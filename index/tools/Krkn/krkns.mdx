# Tailscale

## TS Net

Because this is using the TSNet it will need to be configured with its own address on tailscale. When you start the server you will be prompted to either supply an environment variable or click a link to approve the new node. An admin must approve this link before it can serve on Tailscale.

## Hostname

The hostname that will be registered on Tailscale will be either what is set for hostname in the configs + -krkn or the hosts default hostname-krkn. This is to make it easily identifiable.

## Ready State

When the server is ready and listening on the TSNet you will not see it in ss or ps/netstat commands. You will see a notification indicating the **AuthLoop** state is: `Running; done`
