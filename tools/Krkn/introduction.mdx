# The Tale of Krkn

Krkn was born out of years of frustration doing hash cracking the “normal” way in real offensive security engagements.

At KrakenTech, we’ve lived the reality of shared cracking boxes, waiting in line for access, copying hashes around with `scp`, downloading them off attack infrastructure, and manually relocating them onto whatever GPU rig happened to be free. We’ve all babysat `hashcat` processes, repeatedly checking status, waiting for a job to finish so we could tell the next person, “It’s free now.”

We’ve also suffered through the operational friction: awkward web interfaces, clunky authentication, trying to interact with browser-based tooling from headless servers, or resorting to `curl` and ad-hoc scripts just to move files and results around.

This workflow doesn’t scale. It wastes time, breaks focus, and turns what should be an automated, background process into a constant manual coordination problem.

We’ve been there. So we decided to redesign what hash cracking should look like.

Krkn is the result: a distributed, fault-tolerant hash cracking platform designed for real offensive security teams. It removes the need to manually shuttle files, wait for machines, or babysit jobs. Work can be batched intelligently based on flags and job characteristics, dispatched across multiple cracking nodes, and results are fed back automatically to the people who need them—when they’re ready.

Instead of managing infrastructure and process, you focus on the engagement. Krkn handles the rest.

# Your Data is Always Yours

Krkn Server is a fully offline, on-prem solution. The data you collect should be yours and only yours. To facilitate this, we include a key-value database that utilizes BadgerDB and hardware information to encrypt stored information.

# Licensing

In order to maintain the offline solution, Krkn utilizes a signed krkn.license file. Without this file the server will not run. In this file is an expiration date for the Krkn Server. If the expiration date is met or exceeded, the Krkn Server will no longer facilitate activity but it will not delete your data. 

To fix this, a new license file must be obtained from KrakenTech LLC for the service. Simply place the license file into the same directory as the Krkn Server binary and restart the server.

# Network

The Krkn Server was built to work over VPNs and has a direct integration with Tailscale. The goal was secure communications to routable addresses over tunnels to perform crackign operations in a cli application. 

The intention was to present a workflow that did not require client data to leave a secure tunnel or have to be downloaded between multiple hosts and uploaded to a cracking server, leaving room for forgotton client data on employee machines.

# First Time Setup

Upon launching the Krkn Server if a database does not yet exist, the user will be prompted to begin the first time setup process.

### Specifying a Sending Email

In order to begin a new Krkn server, a sending email must be provided. Currently only outlook email addresses are supported.

This sending email will be used to add new users to the Krkn Server.

Next, an app password must be provided for the sending email. This can be generated at the [Microsoft Security Info](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info) page.

### Admin User

After selecting a sending email, the admin user must be created. To do so, we first supply a username followed by an email address.

Once the admin user information has been populated, a token email will be sent to the admin user from the sending email.

### Confirming the Token

Once the token is received, the user can then provide it to the Krkn Server to verify receipt and initialize the server.
