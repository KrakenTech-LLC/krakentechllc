Upon launching the Krkn Server if a database does not yet exist, the user will be prompted to begin the first time setup process.

### Specifying a Sending Email

In order to begin a new Krkn server, a sending email must be provided.

Currently only the following SMTP Senders are implemented:

- Outlook
  - The app password can be generated at the [Microsoft Security Info](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info) page.
- Google
  - The app password can be generated at the \<\> page.
- Mailgun
- Sengrid
- Standard SMTP
  - TLS
  - StartTLS

This sending email will be used to:

- Add new users to the Krkn Server.
- Reset user tokens

### Admin User

After selecting a sending email, the admin user must be created. To do so, we first supply a username followed by an email address.

Once the admin user information has been populated, a token email will be sent to the admin user from the sending email.

### Confirming the Token

Once the token is received, the user can then provide it to the Krkn Server to verify receipt and initialize the server.
